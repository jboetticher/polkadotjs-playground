# polkadot-js playground

This is where I make functions and play around with the polkadot-js SDK. Hopefully some of these functions will make my job easier.

### findExternalAssets
```
ts-node findExternalAssets.ts -network NETWORK -includeName boolean
```
- -network (-n):        The network to use (moonbeam, moonriver, moonbase).
- -includeName (-N):    Optional. Include if you want each asset's name to appear.
